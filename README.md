The work for lab-1 is in problem-1, problem-2 and problem-3.

The first problem is with the responsive grid, which adjusts to the size of the screen.

The second problem is to develop a note-taking app that can create notes, view them, delete them, and change their background color. To change the color, you must click the three colour buttons.

The third problem was to make some changes to the provided files, which resulted in the creation of a chrome extension that makes text bold.
